# About
Mercaprecios aims to automate historic price analysis by leveraging Mercadona's e-ticket functionality,
where tickets for your purchase are not printed, but sent to your preferred email address.

# How it works
Every email sent to Mercaprecio's inbox (TBD) will be parsed, and pricing information will be extracted
from the attached Mercadona tickets, which is later stored in a database for further analysis.

# How to contribute
## With pricing information
The easiest way to contribute is by setting up automatic forwarding of your tickets
to Mercaprecio's inbox (TBD).

## With code
Feel free to check out the roadmap and contribute with PRs.

# Disclaimer
Only pricing information from the emails is parsed and stored. The rest of the email contents are completely
ignored. You can verify this yourself by checking what the code is doing.
